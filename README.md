On 16 February 2018, the Shared Data Unit [revealed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42749973) Britain's bus network had shrunk to levels last seen in the late 1980s.

Rising car use and cuts to public funding were blamed by commentators for a loss of 134 million miles of coverage over the past decade alone.

The BBC’s analysis however challenged the previous consensus rural areas were worst hit.

We showed bus coverage in metropolitan areas had dropped by a tenth since 2013-14 while rural areas had seen bus routes cut by 7.8%.
