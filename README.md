On 16 February 2018, the Shared Data Unit [revealed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42749973) Britain's bus network had shrunk to levels last seen in the late 1980s.

Rising car use and cuts to public funding were blamed by commentators for a loss of 134 million miles of coverage over the past decade alone.

The BBCâ€™s analysis however challenged the previous consensus rural areas were worst hit.

We showed bus coverage in metropolitan areas had dropped by a tenth since 2013-14 while rural areas had seen bus routes cut by 7.8%.
